### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Sashe Vuchkov and I'm a web developer with a strong interest in direct response marketing.

I like to create web assets that generate profits (or miserably fail fast) as soon as they are online. I think it's painful to wait weeks or months to find out if a business idea or a product has potential, so I always strive to get "the numbers" fast.

From a marketing standpoint...
It's essential for me my websites, landing pages, and other assets be planned out for conversions and sales from the beginning. I like to write sales copy and I like to run my ads, so I have some understating of specialties like copywriting, advertising, and online marketing.

All this helps me to deliver web assets suitable for direct response campaigns.

My passion for digital marketing has been with me for a decade, and it drives me to always lookout for opportunities to apply my knowledge and skills.

From a web development standpoint...
I'm a "web resident' since the year 2000 with a coding experience dating back to 2006, and I love almost everything related to the World Wide Web. I adore most web technologies and every minute spent writing code is a sweet pleasure for me.

My code is clean and looks beautiful on the screen. Or at least I think so... Of course, there is always room for improvement, but I'm not a perfectionist, so I produce "good enough" stuff that brings results. After all - we are not here to win academy awards for algorithm efficiency or something like that.

My strongest advantage is my business-oriented style of web development. Everything I do must align with your business goals, so there is no "code fluff," "bloat' or whatever that looks or sounds good but has ZERO contribution to your bottom line.

Everything should serve your business profitably.
