## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Sashe Vuchkov, and I'm a web developer with a strong interest in online marketing.

It's my pleasure to create and market free stuff...

### Why?

Because it's cool to give back to the community. We all benefit from many open-source projects on a daily basis, and my way to be grateful for all this is to strive to be more than a consumer. 

Moreover, it's my hobby to create all kinds of things - content, software, websites, etc. - and I do it for pleasure, so it makes sense to me to give away a large part of my creations. Yeah, some of them I sell, but life just can't be all about money, or I don't want it to be that way. 

Also, I like to create web assets that generate success (or miserably fail fast) as soon as they are online. I think it's painful to wait weeks or months to find out if a business idea or a product has potential, so I always strive to get "the numbers" fast.

### From a marketing standpoint...

It's essential for me my projects, websites, and other assets to be planned out for conversions from the beginning. I like to write sales copy, and I like to run my ads, so I have some understanding of specialties like copywriting, advertising, and online marketing.

All this helps me have a clear vision for the details and the Big Picture.

My passion for digital marketing has been with me for a decade, and it drives me to always look out for opportunities to apply my knowledge and skills.

### From a web development standpoint...

I've been a "web resident" since the year 2000 with a coding experience dating back to 2006, and I love almost everything related to the World Wide Web. I adore most web technologies, and every minute spent writing code is sweet honey for me.

My code is clean and looks beautiful on the screen. Or at least I think so... Of course, there is always room for improvement, but I'm not a perfectionist, so I produce "good enough" stuff that brings results.

And by "good enough," I mean well-designed, well-structured, and well-tested software...

But nothing "genius."

My strongest advantage is my business-oriented style of development. Everything I do must align with the business goals, so there is no "code fluff," "bloat' or whatever that looks or sounds good but has ZERO contribution to the bottom line.

Everything should serve the DEFINITE PURPOSE.

### My other activities

I'm passionate not only about writing software.

Actually, I'm into writing itself.

It's weird, you know, but if I were immortal, I would spend most of the time writing and learning all possible genres, formats, and types of writing.

That's how far my craziness goesâ€¦

So I have my blog, where I practice my crazy passion.
