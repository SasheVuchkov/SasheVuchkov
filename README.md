## Hi there üëã

I'm Aleksandar Vuchkov (a.k.a Sashe Vuchkov) from Bulgaria, a full-stack developer (7+ years of experience) who creates well-coded and performant web apps using JavaScript / TypeScript and React.

I strive to fully understand my clients' unique needs and absorb their visionary ideas. Once I immerse myself in your project, you will have a trusted person who can make your dreams a reality.

Here's what some of my clients wrote:

üëç "Alex is a fantastic full-stack developer whose expert knowledge of React, TypeScript, and Next.js has been very valuable during the implementation of our project. Alex is extremely communicative. He takes ownership of his work. He shares great ideas that tangibly help to improve our product every week that he works on it. He pays attention to details, so there's typically very little wasted time or effort. And he is eager to learn when he is confronted with something new. In short, Alex brings a combination of technical expertise, proactive communication, and a deep commitment to excellence -- we're fortunate to be working with him!"

üëç "In a short space of time, Alex has already made a big contribution to our project. He is a highly knowledgeable developer -- attentive to detail, patient, clear in his communication, and friendly to work with. He carefully examines problems and comes up with effective ideas to resolve them. We're grateful for his expertise, his insights, and the standards of excellence that he strives for."

Of course, JavaScript / TypeScript and React are only some of the technologies involved in your project. I can list others like:

### Backend:

* Node.js / Express.js;
* Next.js / Remix;
* API Integrations;
* REST APIs;
* Third-party integrations;
* PHP / Laravel.

### Front-end:

* HTML5 / CSS3;
* Bootstrap 5 / Tailwind CSS;
* React.js / jQuery / Vanilla JavaScript;
* Chrome Extensions;

### Database:

* SQL / NoSQL;
* PostgreSQL;
* MySQL / MariaDB;
* MongoDB;
* CouchDB;

### Google Cloud Platform (GCP):

* Cloud Run
* Cloud Functions
* Cloud Compute Engine
* Cloud SQL

### Content Management Systems

* Strapi CMS;
* WordPress;
* Basically anything (I learn fast).

### Other:

* Git / Github;
* Parcel / Vite;
* Vercel / Heroku;
* Digital Ocean;
* Open AI / AI APIs;

### Can I deliver on my promises?

Well, I believe I can. I have been a full stack developer since 2018, and some of the projects I've worked on include:

* Profitable websites;
* Headless CMS integrations;
* Support chat;
* Ticket system;
* Hosting administration panel;
* Single-page apps;
* Browser extensions;
* Different utility scripts;
* API integrations;
* Third-party services integrations;
* Responsive web applications;
* From scratch SAAS products;
* Minimal viable products (MVP);
* and more.

I worked for a global hosting company for two years. There, I learned many valuable lessons about high-traffic applications (millions of users monthly), scalability, security, processes, teamwork, and collaboration with web designers, DevOps specialists, marketing professionals, and other stakeholders.

That means I have some knowledge and know-how I can transfer to your project, too.

I always strive to keep the project scope on track and eliminate anything that isn't mission-critical and is merely "nice to have." It may seem that I'm too strict about this, but it saves my clients time and money. Even more important, it makes their apps better and lighter, consuming fewer server or browser resources, thus lowering costs.

My oldest client (5+ years), who doesn't have a profile here, says:

üëç "I trust Aleksandar completely with the online presence of my business, and I am grateful to him for the dedication and professionalism he demonstrates in working with me. I would gladly recommend his services."
